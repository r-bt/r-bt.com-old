  <p>
    Hey, ðŸ‘‹. I'm Richard. I'm 19, live in Ireland and am currently on a Gap
    Year.
    <br />
    Next year I'll be studying computer science (probably) at MIT.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've worked on lots of different projects but I'm hoping to begin a clean
    slate
    <br />
    with this website. So expect this website to update over the next year
  </p>

  <h3>Contact me</h3>
  <p>If you're like me and also talking to people but are nervous when starting conversations, <br> here's some ways to contact me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ask for comments on a blog you've recently written</li>
    <li>Talk about an interesting thought that came to you</li>
    <li>Talk about project you've been working on</li>
  </ul>

    P.S: This site is made with
    <a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="noopener">Svelte</a>
    and
    <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" rel="nopener">Sapper</a>. If you make
