<Profile title="ESG - ðŸ§© Learning Communities â€“ MIT" />

Key points:

- Provides [GIRs](https://firstyear.mit.edu/academics-exploration/general-institute-requirements-girs) in samll discussion based classes (~12 people)
- Can mix & match ESG and mainstream GIRs
- Has communitiy activites, lunches, study sessions, etc
- Limited to 55 people
- Is my advising seminar. What's an advising seminar?

From experience I much prefer and do better in discussion based classes and learning from others, making this very appealing.

- Having to actually think about the content and getting the chance in class to talk about it sounds great
- Seems like they're interested in teaching methods which is super cool (since most teaching is highly ineffiecent)

They also run seminars for all students, really interesting topics:

- ES.92 Authenticity - How to live an authentic life throuhg works of eastern & western philosophers
- ES.S90 Designing Adaptive Prison Solutions - Designing prisions that are approriate for those with disabilities

I wonder are the classes always different or do they repeat?

Also provides a social space and events to attend.
